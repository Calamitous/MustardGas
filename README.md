Mustard Gas (HN3) for Hacker News
=================================

Mustard Gas is a Google Chrome extension for displaying the top 3 news items from Hacker News.

Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com) is a wonderful site full of interesting articles, and is an amazing timesink.  This extension allows you to quickly check the top three headlines without getting sucked into clicking on dozens of fascinating links.

It installs a small button in the title bar that pops up a list of the top three articles.  The headlines links to the "comments" section of Hacker News, and the "Article" link points to the original article the headline references.

Improvements over Hacker News:

* Only shows the top three links from HN
* Links are larger and easier to click
* Headline links go to comments, instead of the article
